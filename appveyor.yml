# See http://www.appveyor.com/docs/appveyor-yml for many more options
# Notes:
#   - Minimal appveyor.yml file is an empty file. All sections are optional (perhaps not 'build'. set it
#     to 'off' as I have below if not needed).
#   - Indent each level of configuration with 2 spaces. Do not use tabs!
#   - All section names are case-sensitive.
#   - Section names should be unique on each level.
#   - appveyor.yml and UI coexistence:
#      It's worth noticing that both appveyor.yml and UI configuration are mutually exclusive.
#      It's always either YAML or UI - the settings from each are not merged. If you have appveyor.yml
#      in your repo it will override all settings made on the UI unless explicitly disabled by Ignore
#      appveyor.yml. There are few exceptions, which are:
#        1. Environment variables. Variables defined on UI are getting merged with those ones defined
#           in appveyor.yml. Variable values with the same names are getting overridden with values from UI.
#        2. Notification settings defined on UI are getting merged with those ones defined in appveyor.yml.
#        3. Build version format is taken from UI if it is not set in appveyor.yml.
